41 Post - Created by DimasTheDriver on July/22/2012 . Part of the 'Unity: capturing the video input from multiple webcams' post. Available at: http://www.41post.com/?p=4854.

The scenes are placed inside the 'Scenes' folder. Their names should be self explanatory:


* 'SingleWebCamera' scene: it has the script that displays the video input of a single web camera.
* 'MultipleWebCameras' scene: it has the script that features the possibility to switch between different cameras.


Both scripts are attached to the 'Plane' game object.
